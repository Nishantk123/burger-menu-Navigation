*****EVent bubbing issue

In this project First We have create parent div (className = App) and added Click event listener.
in side parent element we have added button as child component and added on click listener. When we 
are tapping on button, both listener are fired. so for get tide of this event bubbing issue We have
id on both parent and child component. and getting Id by document.getElementById and controlling the 
parent event by javascript


******* Right Implementation
    * first we have created button along with menu
    * After tapping on button we are adding className and css-animation, style with the help of 
                document.getElementById 
                classlist.added 
                classlist.toggle
    * another click on  button, we are removing className and style
    * For clicking outside of both button or anywhere in screen we are again removing or closing the menu
    * For  solving the Event budding We have used javascript to controll the event 
    * For full implementation we have used React, javascript, css
    * for shlowing the current menu we have used react state to manage the state of application
    * for retaining the burger state we are pusing the state to localstorage
